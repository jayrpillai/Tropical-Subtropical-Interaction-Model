# Tropical-Subtropical-Interaction-Model
Current model (in progress) and manuscript detailing model equations/setup

This model (affectionately/angrily called CLARENCE) is an idealized framework for studying the reaction of low clouds to radiative forcing, created during the summer of 2021 at Colorado State University with David Randall and his group. 

Currently, the model is still in the process of being tuned, but a manuscript of the equations and model setup can be found here, along with the current state of the model.
